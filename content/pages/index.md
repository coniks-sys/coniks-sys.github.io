<h4><b>What is CONIKS?</b></h4>
<p>
CONIKS is a key management system for end users capable of integration in 
end-to-end secure communication services. The main idea is that users should 
not have to worry about managing encryption keys when they want to 
communicate securely, but they also should not have to trust their secure 
communication service providers to act in their interest.

<h4><b>Why Key Transparency Matters</b></h4>
<p>
CONIKS protects end-to-end encrypted communications from malicious or 
compromised communication providers and surveillance by storing users' encryption keys in 
tamper-evident and publicly auditable key directories. This allows messaging 
clients to verify the identity of users automatically, and prevents 
malicious/compromised providers from hijacking secure communications without 
getting caught.
